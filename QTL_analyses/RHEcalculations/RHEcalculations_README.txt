Script and files to calculate relative homozygous effect (RHE) for QTLs.

Script:
Convert_RHE_final.py

Input files:
Parent_Means_200821.txt

For GWS (conservative) QTL set:
Final_GenoPhenoMeansNum_qtlCon_200827m.txt
Final_HK_markersList_200828.csv

For all QTLs (CWS) set:
GenoPhenoMeansNum_10000KLO_200820m.txt
GenotypePeakInfo_all_200821.txt
peaks_ChromKLO_operm10000_AddEff_200820.txt

Manually modified files with information to change the signs/direction of the RHE given whether 11/22 was associated with CC/LL genotypes
CC = cordatotriloba homozygous genotypes
LL = lacunosa homozygous genotypes

Final tables:
