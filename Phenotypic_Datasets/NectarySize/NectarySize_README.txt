Files and scripts for measuring and calculating nectary size from images.

Dropbox link to nectary photos: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/yuecpvp671tm501/AAAis_xMYj9fz0PymRSoclSza?dl=0
Raw image files in JPG. Files with "points" designated from FIJI - TIFF (open with FIJI to see the points).

Combine nectary size raw data points from FIJI, and then estimation of nectary size from data points.

Scripts to convert x,y coordinates of points into distances to estimate nectary size:
NectaryDataConversion_for1file_final.py
NectaryDataConversion_mostImages_final.py

Files:
measurements_191203_200121.txt - use with NectaryDataConversion_for1file_final.py
measurements_19XXXX_20XXXX.txt - use with NectaryDataConversion_mostImages_final.py
